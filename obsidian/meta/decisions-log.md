## ADR-0015 — Strict three-tier design-token naming convention

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2026-07-17

**Context.** ADR-0004 made tokens the styling currency but never said what a token
should be *called*. The starter shipped two tokens (`--background`,
`--foreground`) and no grammar, so every project built from it would invent its
own — defeating the point of a shared starter, since an agent moving between
projects could not predict a token name without reading `globals.css`. Reference
taken from [Mavik Labs — *Design Tokens in Tailwind v4*](https://www.maviklabs.com/blog/design-tokens-tailwind-v4-2026/)
(three tiers: primitive → semantic → component).

**Decision.** Adopt the three-tier model with an explicit grammar, documented in
[[design-system]] and codified as AGENTS.md hard rule #4:

| Tier | Grammar | Lives in |
|------|---------|----------|
| Primitive | `--raw-<category>-<name>[-<shade>]` | `:root` |
| Semantic | `--<role>[-<variant>][-<state>]` | `:root` |
| Component | `--<tw-namespace>-<component>[-<property>]` | `@theme inline` |

- Only Tier 1 holds literals; Tier 2 names purpose, never appearance; Tier 2 is
  the themeable layer (dark mode overrides there). No tier may be skipped.
- Every `@theme inline` entry is exactly `--<namespace>-<role>: var(--<role>)`.
  `inline` is load-bearing — it inlines the `var()` into each utility so Tier 2
  overrides cascade; binding a literal freezes the value and breaks theming.
- Tier 3 stays rare by design (ADR-0012 prefers a React component).

**Two deliberate deviations from the reference article**, both verified against
`tailwindcss` v4.3.3 by compiling a probe stylesheet:
1. The article names primitives `--color-blue-500`. We prefix them `--raw-*` and
   keep them out of `@theme` — under Tailwind v4 a `--color-*` entry *generates
   utilities*, so naming primitives that way would emit a `bg-blue-500` for every
   raw value and let markup bypass the semantic tier.
2. The article lists `--duration-fast` / `--duration-normal` next to `--ease-*`.
   **There is no `--duration-*` namespace in Tailwind v4** — the probe confirmed
   `duration-fast` compiles to nothing and the variable is not even emitted from
   `@theme inline`. Durations therefore stay Tier 2 only, consumed as
   `duration-[var(--duration-fast)]`. (`--ease-*` *is* a real namespace and is used.)

Retrofit is **minimal and unopinionated**: the existing background/foreground
tokens were restructured into the tiers, and the primitives/durations/`--ease-entrance`
/`--leading-display` they imply were added. **No brand palette was invented** —
the convention is the deliverable; projects add `--raw-color-brand-*` themselves.

**Consequences.** Token names are now predictable across every project from this
starter. This **amends ADR-0004**, which said only that new values go in
`globals.css` first — they must now also follow the tier grammar. `globals.css`
grew a documented tier structure but stays bounded (ADR-0012). Existing markup is
unaffected: `bg-background` / `text-foreground` still resolve, since the Tier 2
names and `@theme` bindings kept their public names.

## ADR-0014 — Narrow CSS-transition exception for trivial state changes

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2026-07-17

**Context.** ADR-0002 banned CSS transitions outright to force every motion
through the spring layer. In practice the ban's cost lands hardest where its
benefit is lowest: a nav link fading its colour on hover had to become a client
component wrapping `<Hover>` with a spring config, to animate one property that
no user will ever interrupt or perceive as physical. The rule pushed teams toward
either boilerplate or quiet rule-breaking.

**Decision.** Keep hard rule #1 for all real motion; carve out one narrow,
condition-bound exception. CSS `transition-*` is allowed **only** for simple,
discrete state changes — `hover:` / `focus-visible:` / `active:` colour, opacity,
border-colour, underline, and small decorative nudges — subject to three
conditions, all required:

1. **Token-backed timing** — `duration-[var(--duration-fast)] ease-entrance`; raw
   ms/cubic-bezier values remain banned by hard rule #4.
2. **`transition-*` only** — `@keyframes` stay banned outright. Anything long
   enough to need keyframes is long enough to deserve a spring.
3. **Utilities only** — the transition lives in `className`, never in a CSS file
   (ADR-0012).

Everything scroll-driven, revealing, layout-affecting, staggered, orchestrated,
or interruptible remains spring-based; text remains [[text-engine]]. Anything
past the allowed list is `<Hover>`.

**Consequences.** A hover colour change no longer needs a client component — the
common case gets cheaper and the spring layer keeps the cases it is actually good
at. This **amends ADR-0002**, whose "CSS transitions are banned" is now "CSS
keyframes are banned; transitions are limited to the list above". The exception is
deliberately narrow and enumerated rather than a judgement call ("simple
animations") so it cannot erode into general CSS animation. `--raw-duration-*` /
`--duration-*` / `--ease-entrance` tokens exist to serve it (ADR-0015).
[[animation-system]], [[design-system]], and [[ai-agent-guide]] updated to match.

## ADR-0013 — `<Inview>` self-observe fix; spring components honour resize

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2026-06-07

**Context.** `<Inview>` only animated when an external `trigger` ref was passed.
Without one it never revealed. Root cause: `useDynamicInView` returns its target
attachment as a **callback ref** (`setNode`) in the first tuple slot, but
`in-view.tsx` destructured it as `inViewRef` and wrote `inViewRef.current = node`
in the JSX `ref` callback — assigning `.current` to a function instead of calling
it. `setNode` never ran, the observed `node` stayed `null`, and with no `trigger`
the observer had nothing to watch (`trigger?.current ?? node` → `null`). With a
`trigger` it worked only because `trigger.current` bypassed the dead `node` path.
TypeScript flagged this at build time (`Property 'current' does not exist on type
'TargetRefCallback'`), so the build was already failing.

Separately, `<Inview>`, `<Spring>`, and `<Hover>` tracked `width`
(`useWindowWidth()`) as a `useMemo`/`useEffect` dependency to re-evaluate mobile
gating on resize, but never passed it to `isMobileDisabled()` — so the value was
genuinely unused (ESLint `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` warning) **and** resize
re-evaluation silently did nothing; the check always read `window.innerWidth` at
call time.

**Decision.** This is the second authorized edit to the `#do-not-modify` engine
(after ADR-0009). Two corrections:
1. In `in-view.tsx`, call the callback ref — `setInViewNode(node)` — instead of
   assigning `.current`, so the component observes itself when no `trigger` is
   given.
2. Pass the React-tracked `width` into every `isMobileDisabled(value, width)`
   call across `in-view.tsx`, `spring.tsx`, and `hover.tsx`. This is the
   documented second parameter of `isMobileDisabled` and makes the `width`
   dependency meaningful, fixing resize re-evaluation and clearing the lint
   warnings.

**Consequences.** `<Inview>` now works standalone (the common case). `yarn build`
and `yarn lint` are both clean (0 errors, 0 warnings). The springs folder remains
`#do-not-modify` by default — these were explicitly signed-off bug fixes.

## ADR-0012 — Styling lives in utilities and components, not `globals.css`

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2026-05-22

**Context.** ADR-0004 made design tokens the styling currency and ruled that
"new values must be added to `globals.css` first." Combined with the
design-system guidance to *"extract repeated multi-class patterns to
`@layer components`"*, the path of least resistance for any repeated visual
pattern became a named class in `globals.css`. On an animation-heavy,
multi-section marketing site that grows the file without bound — a single
global stylesheet accumulating hundreds of component-specific classes that are
never deleted when their component is. The fix is a placement rule, not a
file-splitting trick: splitting `globals.css` into many files only spreads the
same bloat.

**Decision.** Styling follows a strict placement order; `globals.css` stays
bounded by design.

- One-off styling → **Tailwind utilities** in `className`. Nothing enters CSS.
- A repeated pattern with markup/structure/props → a **React component**
  (`components/ui/`), *not* a CSS class. This is the default answer to "this
  looks repeated" — e.g. an eyebrow label with a `::before` dot is an
  `<Eyebrow>` component, not a `.label-eyebrow` class.
- A repeated pure-utility combo with no structure → a Tailwind v4 `@utility`.
- `@layer components` is reserved **strictly** for what utilities and
  components genuinely cannot express: pseudo-elements (`::before`/`::after`),
  third-party DOM overrides (`!important` on library markup), complex
  descendant/state selectors.
- `globals.css` only ever holds: `@import`, tokens (`:root` + `@theme`), base
  element resets (`@layer base`), and the narrow `@layer components`
  exceptions above. If it grows past that, something was misplaced.
- CSS Modules were considered and **rejected** — a second styling mechanism
  for the rare bespoke-CSS case is not worth the extra mental model when
  motion is spring-based (no keyframes — ADR-0002) and utilities + components
  cover everything else.

**Consequences.** `globals.css` stays a few-hundred-line file indefinitely.
"Repeated thing" pressure now pushes toward React components — which the
project wants anyway. This **amends ADR-0004**: design *tokens* still go in
`globals.css` first, but component-specific *classes* no longer do.
[[design-system]] and [[component-conventions]] updated to match.

## ADR-0011 — API layer: `app/api` route handlers, secrets server-side

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2026-05-22

**Context.** The starter had no API layer. It needs a convention for reaching
external services that keeps secret keys off the client and gives endpoints a
consistent shape.

**Decision.** External calls go through Next.js Route Handlers —
`src/app/api/<resource>/route.ts`:
- **The handler owns the work** — business logic, multiple upstream calls,
  filtering, and reading secret env vars all live in `route.ts`. No mandatory
  passthrough service layer; extract shared code only when genuinely reused.
- Secrets are safe in handlers because `route.ts` is never bundled to the
  browser. Secret env vars are **unprefixed**; `NEXT_PUBLIC_` only for
  browser-safe values.
- Every endpoint: validates input with `zod`, returns the `{ data }` /
  `{ error }` envelope via the shared `handle()` wrapper (`src/lib/api/`), runs
  on the Node runtime (not Edge).
- `src/env.ts` validates env with zod — `publicEnv` vs `getServerEnv()`.
- Client Components fetch via `apiFetch` (`src/lib/api-client.ts`), same-origin
  only. Render-time data is read in Server Components.
- Added `zod`. The example endpoint is `app/api/contact/route.ts`.
- Codified as **AGENTS.md hard rule #9**.

**Consequences.** A clear, secret-safe API convention (full note:
[[api-architecture]]). Server Actions were considered for mutations but
deferred — for now everything goes through `app/api`. The choice can be
revisited if forms need progressive enhancement. First server dependency
(`zod`) and first server-only env var (`CONTACT_ENDPOINT`) now exist.

## ADR-0010 — SEO & performance hardening

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2026-05-21

**Context.** A review found gaps that would hurt a production marketing site:
`metadataBase` defaulted to `null` (relative OG/canonical URLs never resolved to
absolute — broken social previews); `themeColor` sat on the deprecated metadata
field; there was no `robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml`, or structured data; the
`next.config.ts` was empty; `ScrollLayout` leaked a `requestAnimationFrame`
loop; the home view was a top-level `"use client"` (violating hard rule #6);
and the animation-heavy starter ignored `prefers-reduced-motion`.

**Decision.**
- **Site config.** `src/lib/site.ts` (`siteConfig`) is the single source of
  truth for SEO, fed by `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` (fallback `http://localhost:3000`).
- **Metadata.** `metadataBase` is always set; `themeColor` moved to a
  `generateViewport()` / `viewport` export; dead `keywords` / `other` tags
  dropped; OG dimensions corrected to match the asset.
- **Crawlability.** Added `app/robots.ts`, `app/sitemap.ts`, and a JSON-LD
  `Organization`+`WebSite` helper rendered once in the root layout.
- **App Router files.** Added `loading.tsx` (enables streaming), `error.tsx`,
  `not-found.tsx`.
- **Rendering.** `HomeView` is a Server Component; client-only animation moved
  to the `HomeShowcase` leaf — models hard rule #6 instead of breaking it.
- **Reduced motion.** `<ReducedMotion>` calls react-spring's `useReducedMotion`,
  toggling the global `skipAnimation` — one app-root mount covers every spring
  and `spring-text-engine`. Chosen over per-component handling for its reach.
- **Build config.** `next.config.ts` now sets `removeConsole` (prod),
  AVIF/WebP, `next/image` breakpoints aligned to the adaptive-grid widths, and
  `poweredByHeader: false`. React Compiler is left as a documented opt-in (needs
  `babel-plugin-react-compiler`).
- Fixed the `ScrollLayout` Lenis rAF leak (cancel on unmount).

**Consequences.** Social/SEO metadata is correct in production once
`NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` is set. The first project env var now exists (see
[[environment-variables]]). `isBot()` stays available but is discouraged — it
opts routes out of static rendering; reduced-motion is the preferred lever (see
[[seo-metadata]]). React Compiler remains opt-in pending a dependency install.

## ADR-0009 — Shared animation ticker; authorized engine performance refactor

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2026-05-21

**Context.** A performance review of the animation engine found load issues that
scale with the number of animated components on a page:
- `useLoop` started a **private `requestAnimationFrame` loop per hook instance** —
  N scroll-driven components meant N rAF loops, none of which ever stopped.
- `useWindowWidth` attached a **separate debounced `resize` listener per call** —
  one per spring component.
- `useDynamicInView` re-created its `IntersectionObserver` **on every render**
  (effect keyed on an unstable `options` object), and a dead `Proxy` branch
  created observers that were never disconnected.
- `useLoop`'s mount-only effect captured a **stale `onRender`**, so prop changes
  after mount were ignored.
All of this lives under `src/hooks/animation/` and `src/components/animation/springs/`
— `#do-not-modify` (ADR-0002).

**Decision.** With explicit user sign-off, apply a one-time performance refactor
to the protected engine, and introduce a shared, unprotected loop primitive:
- New `src/lib/animation/ticker.ts` — a single app-wide, reference-counted rAF
  loop (`subscribeToTicker`). It starts on the first subscriber, stops on the
  last, and throttles each subscriber independently. **Not** `#do-not-modify` —
  it is the supported extension point.
- `useLoop` now subscribes to the ticker and reads `onRender` / `framerate`
  through refs (fixes the stale-closure bug). Public signature unchanged.
- `useDynamicInView` rewritten without the `Proxy`: one observer, re-created only
  when the observed element or options actually change; exposes a callback ref.
- `use-window-size.ts` (not protected) now serves all three hooks from one
  debounced `resize` listener via `useSyncExternalStore`. The unused
  `debounceDelay` parameter was dropped.
- `mode="forward"` `scroll` listeners in `<Spring>` / `<Inview>` made `passive`.
- Hard rule #2 amended: the engine stays protected by default; changes require
  explicit sign-off.

**Consequences.** A page with N animated components now runs **one** rAF loop and
**one** resize listener instead of N of each, with no observer churn. Public
hook/component APIs are unchanged except `useWindowWidth`/`Height`/`Size`, which
no longer take a `debounceDelay` argument (no caller passed one). This **amends
ADR-0002's** do-not-modify scope.

A follow-up pass then cleared all 13 pre-existing ESLint problems in the engine
(also authorized): `isMobileDisabled` gained an optional `viewportWidth`
argument, missing `disableOnMobile` effect deps were added, a
`trigger.current`-in-cleanup hazard in `<Hover>` was fixed, `<Handle>`'s
transition effects were ref-stabilised, and `useProgressTrigger` now returns
`progress` as a `RefObject<number>` (no consumer affected).

## ADR-0008 — Adaptive scaling grid via root font-size

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2026-05-21

**Context.** An adaptive scaling system was dropped into `src/components/common/`
to keep a rem-based design proportional across viewports. It shipped as a
`styled-components` implementation (`createGlobalStyle`, a `css` `media` helper,
`rm`/`em` helpers, plus `colors.ts` / `fonts.ts` / `utils.ts`). `styled-components`
is not a project dependency, and global CSS belongs in `globals.css` per ADR-0004.

**Decision.** Keep only the scaling behaviour; rebuild it to the project stack.
- **Scale down** (viewport ≤ largest breakpoint) — `vw`-based `html { font-size }`
  media queries in `globals.css`, inside `@layer base`.
- **Scale up** (viewport > largest breakpoint) — a `<AdaptiveGrid>` client
  component (`useAdaptiveGrid` hook) sets an inline `html` font-size at runtime,
  reusing the existing `useResizeLoop` render loop.
- Breakpoints live in `grid.config.ts` as typed config; the `globals.css` media
  queries mirror them and must be kept in sync (formula in both files).
- The dropped `styled-components` files were deleted, not committed.

**Consequences.** A rem-based layout now scales as one unit on every viewport.
`styled-components` stays out of the dependency tree. The breakpoint set is
duplicated across `grid.config.ts` and `globals.css` by design — the CSS-only
config rule (ADR-0004) forbids generating the media queries from JS.

## ADR-0007 — Automate the vault workflow with Claude Code hooks

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2026-05-21

**Context.** The "read the vault first, follow the relevant guide, update the docs
after every change" workflow depended on the user reminding the agent each time.
Documentation drifts the moment it relies on memory.

**Decision.** Encode the workflow as Claude Code hooks in `.claude/settings.json`
(committed, team-wide):
- `SessionStart` — injects a pointer to read the vault first.
- `UserPromptSubmit` — on every request, reminds the agent to consult the relevant
  guide and to update docs for any change made.
- `Stop` — at the end of every turn, blocks **once** to confirm the vault was
  updated. A `${TMPDIR}` marker keyed by session id guarantees it blocks at most
  once per turn (no infinite loop).

**Consequences.** The documentation workflow is enforced without user prompting.
`.claude/settings.json` is now a tracked project file. Hooks are reviewable and
disableable via `/hooks`. New hooks take effect on the next session start (or after
opening `/hooks`). See [[ai-agent-guide]].

---

## ADR-0006 — The vault is the single source of truth

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2026-05-21

**Context.** ADR-0001 left dense spec files (`project-specs.md`, `text-engine-docs.md`)
at the repo root alongside the vault, creating duplication — the same conventions
existed both as terse specs and as expanded vault notes, which would drift.

**Decision.** The vault is the **only** documentation source.
- `project-specs.md` — deleted; its content was already decomposed into the
  `architecture/` and `frontend/` notes (and `environment-variables.md`).
- `text-engine-docs.md` — moved into the vault as [[text-engine-reference]].
- `generic-layout-prompt.md` — moved into the vault (see ADR via [[changelog]]).
- Root keeps only thin shims: `AGENTS.md` carries the breaking-change warning and
  hard rules and points into the vault; `CLAUDE.md` and `.cursorrules` both
  `@`-import `AGENTS.md`.

**Consequences.** No documentation duplication. Agents bootstrap from `AGENTS.md`
and read vault notes on demand. This **amends ADR-0001** — root files no longer
hold canonical spec content.

---

## ADR-0005 — Use standard `next/link` for navigation

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2026-05-21

**Context.** Two conflicting conventions existed: `project-specs.md` specified
standard `next/link` / `useRouter`, while `generic-layout-prompt.md` specified
custom `<AnimLink>` / `useAnimRouter()` wrappers. The custom wrappers were never
built.

**Decision.** Use standard Next.js navigation — `<Link>` from `next/link` and
`useRouter` from `next/navigation`. The `AnimLink` / `useAnimRouter` convention is
dropped. See [[routing]].

**Consequences.** `generic-layout-prompt.md` §5 updated to match. No animated-route-
transition layer exists; if one is needed later, revisit with a new ADR.

---

## ADR-0001 — Adopt an Obsidian vault as the project brain

- **Status:** Accepted — amended by ADR-0006
- **Date:** 2026-05-21

**Context.** Project knowledge was scattered across root markdown files
(`project-specs.md`, `text-engine-docs.md`, `AGENTS.md`). New contributors and AI
agents had no structured map of the system.

**Decision.** Introduce `obsidian/` as an Obsidian vault — a linked, navigable
second brain. Root spec files remain as machine-read sources; the vault expands on
them. See [[ai-agent-guide]].

**Consequences.** Docs must now be maintained alongside code. The vault is the
canonical place to *understand* the project; root files stay canonical for *tooling*.

---

## ADR-0002 — All motion is spring-based (`@react-spring/web`)

- **Status:** Accepted (inherited from starter) — amended by ADR-0014
- **Date:** Project baseline

**Context.** Marketing sites need rich, interruptible, physically natural motion.
CSS transitions and keyframes are rigid; competing libraries add weight.

**Decision.** Use `@react-spring/web` for every animation. A custom component layer
(`src/components/animation/springs/`) wraps it. CSS keyframes and `framer-motion`
are **banned**. CSS transitions were banned outright here; **ADR-0014 narrows that
to allow `transition-*` for trivial hover/focus state changes only.**

**Consequences.** All animation goes through the [[animation-system]]. The springs
folder is `#do-not-modify`. Text animation is delegated to [[text-engine]].

---

## ADR-0003 — Routes delegate to Views

- **Status:** Accepted (inherited from starter)
- **Date:** Project baseline

**Context.** Mixing routing concerns with page UI makes `app/` files heavy and hard
to test.

**Decision.** `app/**/page.tsx` files only import and render a component from
`src/views/`. All layout/UI logic lives in the view. See [[routing]].

**Consequences.** Every route is a 3-line file. Views are the real page components.

---

## ADR-0004 — Tailwind v4 with CSS-based config

- **Status:** Accepted (inherited from starter) — amended by ADR-0012 and ADR-0015
- **Date:** Project baseline

**Context.** Tailwind v4 removes `tailwind.config.js` in favour of CSS-native config.

**Decision.** All theme tokens live in `globals.css` under `:root` and `@theme inline`.
No JS config file. Raw values in class names are banned. See [[design-system]].

**Consequences.** Design tokens are the only styling currency. New values must be
added to `globals.css` first — and, per ADR-0015, must follow the three-tier
naming convention.
